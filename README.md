# itsa-cli
Command line interface for itsa-server

Install Gulp globally:

```
npm install -g gulp
```

If you want linting in your project, you need to install es-lint globally:

```
npm install -g eslint
```

Because we also need to lint React syntax, you need to install eslint-plugin-react globally:

```
npm install -g eslint-plugin-react
```


Once you have all these packages, you can create a new web-application like this:

### Step 1:

```js
itsa create appname
```

`appname` will become a new folder with all approriate files.

### Step 2: npm install

Goto the created folder and run:

```js
npm install
```

You can start right away building your application. Any help can be found at [http://itsaserver.io](http://itsaserver.io).
